1. My first idea for the final project is creating a virtual map of building floor, my room for 
example. I want to generate the virtual representation of my current room, so users can navigate
throught my room virtually. I've always wanted to create an environment in virtual world so 
people can easily navigate and explore, grasping the sense of touring.

2. Second idea is a virtual theater / lecture room, where users can view a virtual film / lecture 
in the virtualy created scene. People can watch lecture recordings or downloaded films alone, but 
to give the feeling of watching something together with other people, interacting with peers in 
class, I though making this virtual lecture / theater would be cool idea.

3. The two ideas I mentioned are virtual reality applications, but they are not really interactive. 
As a third idea, I want to make something that is more interactive, actually moving things and 
triggering actions. I want to build a virtual lego session, where the users can grab and assemble 
virtual lego pieces and create their own products. Legos are expensive in real life, so I thought 
this would be cool application of VR and lego, playing around with virtual blocks.
